  Node types  - describing how to map the lifecycle of simple resource.
  In this specific example we use an http daemon as the resource.
  The webserver/start.sh and stop.sh will be called to instantiate and decommission the service
  The web server will run on the <manager host>:8000

imports:
  - https://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/6.3.0/types.yaml

inputs:
  webserver_port:
    description: The HTTP web server port
    default: 8000

node_templates:

  # A node type referencing an http_web_server resource.
  # Implementing the cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle interface as part of the node definition
  # allows us to plug the specific business logic at each point of the lifecycle event.
  # In this example the actual instantiation of the http server is handled by the webserver/start.sh app_script which is called at the [start] lifecycle event
  http_web_server:
    type: cloudify.nodes.WebServer
    properties:
      port: { get_input: webserver_port }
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        start:
          implementation: webserver/start.sh
          executor: central_deployment_agent
        stop:
          implementation: webserver/stop.sh
          executor: central_deployment_agent

# The capabilities expose the relevant resource attributes that are needed by external users or applications
# The local_url is used in the case that the manager runs as a local docker image
# The remote_url refers to the a case in which the manager runs remotely
capabilities:
  local_url:
    description: local endpoint of the application.
    value: { concat: [ 'http://localhost:' , { get_input: webserver_port } ]  }
  remote_url:
    description: The external endpoint of the application.
    value: { concat: [ 'Since this is an example, copy the manager ip/dns and append the following port ' , { get_input: webserver_port } ]  }
