  The relationship blueprint describes how to create dependencies between multiple node types resources
  In this case were adding a web application node (web calculator) that will be contained_in the http_web_server resource
  Note that the application is pulled from a git repository and can be easily modified to any other application as needed.
  See the app_scripts/create.sh to see how this is done.
  The webserver and application will run on the <manager host>:8000


imports:
  - https://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/6.3.0/types.yaml

inputs:

  webserver_port:
    description: The HTTP web server port
    default: 8000

  app_git:
    description: A url of a web based javascript application
    default:  https://github.com/zxcodes/Calculator

  # The web_app is a nodeJS Calculator application.
  # We will fetch this application from a git repo by calling app_scripts/create.sh as part of the create: lifecycle event.
  # The cloudify.relationships.contained_in will tell Cloudify to run the lifecycle operation of this node type on the same host that was created by the http_web_server node above
  # This also means that this web_app node will run only after the http_web_server has been deployed successfully
