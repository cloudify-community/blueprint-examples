# FortiGate Firewall

This blueprint installs the NGFW Single VM on Azure.

### Prerequisites

First make sure that you have satisfied the global requirements in the [main README](../README.md).

* These additional secrets should exist on your manager:
  * `fortigate_username`: Username for Fortigate VM. It is set during provisioning and used during configuration, "admin" is not allowed. You can set this up via the CLI: `cfy secrets create fortigate_username -s [secret value]`.
  * `fortigate_password`: Password for Fortigate VM. It is set during provisioning and used during configuration. The supplied password must be between 6-72 characters long and must satisfy at least 3 of password complexity requirements from the following: Contains an uppercase character, Contains a lowercase character, Contains a numeric digit, Contains a special character. Control characters are not allowed. . You can set this up via the CLI: `cfy secrets create fortigate_password -s [secret value]`.
  * `fortigate_license`: Content of license file, its used during provisioning to license Fortigate. You can set this up via the CLI: `cfy secrets create fortigate_license -s [secret value]`.

## Provisioning

* Blueprint: The `infrastructure.yaml` blueprint is responsible for FortiGate NGFW Single VM provisioning. This VM is connected to 3 networks:
  * Management
  * WAN
  * LAN

The networks' NICs are connected to the security group created in the network deployment. The networks and security group names are fetched from network deployment using `get_capability` intrinsic function.

* Inputs:
  * `fortigate_license_filename`: This is the name of the Fortigate license file. It will be uploaded to Fortigate VM with this name. It should have .lic file extension. Default: `FGVM02TM19000054.lic`.
  * `vm_size`: Name of Virtual Machine Size in Azure. Default: `Standard_B2s`.
  * `vm_os_family`: Default: `linux`.
  * `vm_image_publisher`: Name of the organization that created the image. Default: `fortinet`.
  * `vm_image_offer`: The name of a group of related images created by a publisher. Default: `fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5`
  * `vm_image_sku`: An instance of an offer, such as a major release of a distribution. Default: `fortinet_fg-vm`
  * `vm_image_version`: Version of the image. Default: `6.0.3`.
  * `azure_network_deployment_name`: Name of deployment responsible for creation resource group, security group and networks. Default: `VNFM-Networking-Prov-Azure-networks`.

### Installation

Upload the blueprint, create the deployment and execute install workflow in one command using the CLI:

```bash
cfy install  infrastructure.yaml -b  \
    VNFM-Fortigate-Prov-Azure-vm
```

###Uninstalling

Uninstall the **VNFM-Fortigate-Prov-Azure-vm** deployment:

```
cfy uninstall VNFM-Fortigate-Prov-Azure-vm
```

## Configuration

The configuration requires the IP addresses of the VM created during provisioning, therefore the provisioning deployment name is required as an input. Exposed IP addresses are fetched using `get_capability` function: `{ get_capability: [ {get_input: prov_deployment_name}, wan_ip ] }`.

* Blueprint: The `application.yaml` blueprint is responsible for applying base configuration for the newly created FortiGate VM. It configures all of the interfaces. It consists of one node:
  * `fortigate_vnf_config`: Applies base configuration for Fortigate (VNF name change and basic configuration to interfaces) using [fortigate-baseline.txt](Resources/templates/fortigate-baseline.txt) file.

* Inputs:
  * `fortigate_vm_deployment_name`: Name of Fortigate Provisioning deployment. Default: `VNFM-Fortigate-Prov-Azure-vm`.

### Install

`cfy install application.yaml -b VNFM-Fortigate-Conf`

### Uninstall

`cfy uninstall VNFM-Fortigate-Conf`
