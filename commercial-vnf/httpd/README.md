# HTTPD Webserver

This blueprint installs HTTPD webserver on an Azure or Openstack VM.

### Prerequisites

First make sure that you have satisfied the global requirements in the [main README](../README.md).

* These additional secrets should exist on your manager:
  * `httpd_username`: Username for HTTPD VM. It is set during provisioning and used during configuration, "admin" is not allowed. `ubuntu` is recommended. You can set this up via the CLI: `cfy secrets create httpd_username -s [secret value]`.
  * `httpd_website`: Content of website file for HTTPD VM, it is set during provisioning and served after configuration. Exemplary website can be found under `Resources/website/index.html`.

## Provisioning

* Blueprint: The `azure.yaml` and `openstack.yaml` blueprints are responsible for the creation of an Ubuntu VM. It is connected to 2 networks:
  * Management
  * LAN

The networks' NICs are connected to the security group created in the network deployment. The networks and security group names are fetched from network deployment using `get_capability` intrinsic function.

* Azure inputs:
  * `image`: Image information. Default: `{'publisher': 'Canonical', 'offer': 'UbuntuServer', 'sku': '18.04-LTS', 'version': 'latest}'`.
  * `network_deployment_name`: Name of deployment responsible for creation resource group, security group and networks. Default: `VNFM-Networking-Prov-Azure-networks`.
* Openstack inputs:
  * `vnf_vm_name` - Name of the VM - default: `httpd`
  * `flavor_id` - ID of the flavor in OpenStack - default: `6e2d4276-0390-4a24-b6ab-40f388edcc87`
  * `image_id` - ID of the image in OpenStack - default: `ee6a6582-1351-4f8b-b132-a90b7db88171`
  * `openstack_network_deployment_name` - Name of deployment responsible for router, security group and networks creation -
      default: `VNFM-Networking-Prov-Openstack-networks`

### Installation

Upload the blueprint, create the deployment and execute install workflow in one command using the CLI:

AZURE:
```bash
cfy install  azure.yaml -b  \
    VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Azure-vm
```

OPENSTACK:
```bash
cfy install  openstack.yaml -b  \
    VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Openstack-vm
```

###Uninstalling

Uninstall the deployment:

AZURE:
```
cfy uninstall VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Azure-vm
```

OPENSTACK:
```
cfy uninstall VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Openstack-vm
```

## Configuration

* Blueprint: The `<infrastructure>app.yaml` blueprint is responsible for starting HTTPD process on the target VM, `web_server` node is responsible for creating such server using the following command: `screen -dmS -X python3 -m http.server 8080`. The IP address of the target VM is fetched from VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Azure-vm/VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Openstack-vm deployment using capabilities.

* Inputs:
  * `httpd_vm_deployment_name`: Name of HTTPD Provisioning deployment. Default: `VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Azure-vm` or `VNFM-HTTPD-Prov-Openstack-vm`.

### Install

AZURE:
`cfy install azureapp.yaml -b VNFM-HTTPD-Conf`

OPENSTACK:
`cfy install openstackapp.yaml -b VNFM-HTTPD-Conf`

### Uninstall

`cfy uninstall VNFM-HTTPD-Conf`
