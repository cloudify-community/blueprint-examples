  This is the master blueprint for the Cloudify VNF example. It provisions all the atomic components,
  configures, and then chains them together. In partilucar:
    * prepares the environment, including networks, subnets, security groups etc.
    * provisions F5 BIG-IP VM
    * provisions Fortigate VM
    * provisions webserver VM
    * configures F5 BIG-IP
    * configures Fortigate
    * configures webserver
    * creates a service chain to allow traffic forwarding

# In this section, we import the basic node types, which will be later used in the
# node_templates section to define particular elements of the chain and the
# relationships between them. This section also imports the cloudify-utilities-plugin
# to allow using the Deployment Proxy mechanism.

imports:

# The inputs section includes the names of the particular blueprints and
# deployments which this blueprint will leverage.

  ### PROVISIONING ###

  # F5 Provisioning:
  #   This blueprint is responsible for provisioning the F5 BIG-IP VM in OpenStack
  #   infrastructure, including the necessary network interfaces.
  #   Component is used for the blueprint uploading and the
  #   deployment creation.
  #   A "depends_on" relationship which targets the "network_prov" node is defined.
  #   It means, that during the install workflow, "f5_prov" node will be instantiated
  #   after "network_prov" node will. That will alllow the "f5_prov" node to create network
  #   interfaces in the networks created by "network_prov" blueprint.

  ### CONFIGURATION ###

  # F5 Configuration:
  #   This blueprint is responsible for configuration of the F5 BIG-IP VM

  #   Component is being used for the blueprint uploading and the
  #   deployment creation.

  # Service Chain:
  #   This blueprint is responsible for creating a service chain between the
  #   nodes created in previous steps. It applies the load balancing rules to
  #   the F5 BIG-IP VM and sets a port-forwarding policy on FortiGate VM to
  #   expose a website served by webserver VM on the public interface of the F5
  #   BIG-IP VM.
  #   Component is being used for the blueprint uploading and the
  #   deployment creation.
  #   In the relationships section, there are several "depends_on"
  #   relationships defined. As a result, Cloudify Manager will be waiting
  #   with the service chain creation until all of the particular VNFs, which are
  #   going to be a part of this chain, are properly provisioned & configured
