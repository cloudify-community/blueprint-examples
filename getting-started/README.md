# Cloudify Getting Started

This is a suite of blueprints that demonstrates how to design a Cloudify blueprint, while separating the infrastructure layer and the application layer.

There are three components to this getting started guide:

  - Infrastructure blueprints (there is a separate blueprint for AWS, Azure, Openstack, and GCP). These blueprints are not directly deployed, rather, the application blueprint leverages infrastructure blueprints to deploy the application on the Cloud of the user's choice.
  - JBoss Application blueprint

## Requirements

If you have already ensured these requirements are met, skip to [installation steps](#installation-steps).

- [ ] You will need a Cloudify Manager v5.0.5 or higher. See [install Cloudify Manager](#install-cloudify-manager-with-docker).

- [ ] You must install the following plugins on your Cloudify Manager, however you may skip the Cloud plugin if the Cloud is not relevant to you.

    - [ ] `cloudify-aws-plugin`, version 2.3.0 or higher, see [releases](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-aws-plugin/releases).
    - [ ] `cloudify-azure-plugin`, version 2.1.7 or higher, see [releases](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-azure-plugin/releases).
    - [ ] `cloudify-gcp-plugin`, version 1.4.4 or higher, see [releases](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-gcp-plugin/releases).
    - [ ] `cloudify-openstack-plugin`, version 3.2.2 or higher, see [releases](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-openstack-plugin/releases).

To learn how to upload plugins, see [uploading plugins](#how-to-upload-plugins).

- [ ] You must create the following secrets, however, you may skip those cloud secrets that are not for your cloud.

    - [ ] `agent_key_public`: Public key content, e.g: `cfy secrets create -u agent_key_public -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
    - [ ] `agent_key_private`: Private key content, e.g: `cfy secrets create -u agent_key_private -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
    - [ ] If you wish to use AWS, please create the [required AWS secrets](#aws-secrets-checklist).
    - [ ] If you wish to use Azure, please create the [required Azure secrets](#azure-secrets-checklist).
    - [ ] If you wish to use GCP, please create the [required GCP secrets](#gcp-secrets-checklist).
    - [ ] If you wish to use Openstack, please create the [required Openstack secrets](#openstack-secrets-checklist).

## Installation steps

First you will need to make sure that you have the latest getting-started blueprint. These are located at [Blueprint Examples Releases](https://github.com/cloudify-community/blueprint-examples/releases). Look for the zip archive with a name similar to __getting-started-5.0.5-24.zip__. Copy the link URL. You will need it to complete these steps.

There are two methods to install the getting started application:

1. [Install getting started with the CLI](#install-getting-started-with-the-cli).
1. [Install getting started with the UI](#install-getting-started-with-the-ui).

#### Install Getting Started with the CLI

Upload the blueprint to you Cloudify Manager with the following command:

```shell
cfy blueprints upload [BLUEPRINT URL] -b [BLUEPRINT ID]
```

You can provide any ID you like for the blueprint. You will need it in the following steps.

Create the deployment on your Cloudify Manager with the following command:

```shell
cfy deployments create -b [BLUEPRINT ID]
```

Execute the install workflow on your deployment:

```shell
cfy executions start install -d [BLUEPRINT ID]
```

#### Install Getting Started with the UI

Select **Local Blueprints** from the menu on the left.

On the right side of the local blueprints page, select **Upload**.

Paste the URL of the blueprint package in the **URL** field. Provide any name you like.

Select *mc-jboss.yaml* from the **Blueprint YAML file** menu.

You can leave the **Blueprint icon** field blank. It is only for decoration.

Click **Upload**.

The blueprint should appear in the blueprint list under the name you provided.

On the right, you will see a rocket icon. Select, the rocket icon and you will enter the create deployment dialog.

Provide a name you like in the **Deployment name** field.

You can skip the **Site name** field.

Provide values for any inputs that you would like to change.

Click **Deploy**.

The blueprint should appear in the deployment list under the name you provided.

You can now select **Install** from the workflow menu under your deployment.

### Install Cloudify Manager with Docker

If you have Docker, you can install a Cloudify Manager with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker run --name cfy_manager_local -d --restart unless-stopped -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -p 80:80 -p 8000:8000 cloudifyplatform/community-cloudify-manager-aio
```

### How to upload plugins

There are two methods to upload a plugin on your Cloudify manager:

1. [Uploading plugins with the Cloudify CLI](#Uploading-plugins-with-the-cloudify-cli).
1. [Uploading plugins with the Cloudify UI](#Uploading-plugins-with-the-cloudify-ui).

[Return to requirements](#requirements).

#### Uploading plugins with the Cloudify CLI

If you know the path or URL of the Cloudify Plugin Wagon and Plugin YAML, then you may run the following command:

```shell
cfy plugins upload [URL OR PATH TO PLUGIN WAGON] -y [URL OR PATH TO PLUGIN YAML]
```

#### Uploading plugins with the Cloudify UI

Select **System Resources** from the menu on the left.

Find the **Plugins** widget. By default, this is the first widget on the system resources page.

Click on **Upload**.

Paste the URL of a plugin wagon in the **Wagon file** field.

Paste the URL of the plugin YAML in the **YAML file** field.

Click **Upload**.

### How to create secrets

There are two methods to create a secret on your Cloudify manager:

1. [Create secrets with the Cloudify CLI](#Creating-secrets-with-the-cloudify-cli).
1. [Create secrets with the Cloudify UI](#Creating-secrets-with-the-cloudify-ui).

[Return to requirements](#requirements).

#### Creating secrets with the Cloudify CLI

You can create secrets with the following CLI commands.

If the secret content is a string:

```shell
cfy secrets create [SECRET NAME] -s [SECRET CONTENT]
```

If the secret content is in a file, for example if the secret is a RSA key:

```shell
cfy secrets create [SECRET NAME] -f [PATH TO FILE CONTAINING SECRET CONTENT]
```

#### Creating secrets with the Cloudify UI

Select **System Resources** from the menu on the left.

Find the **Plugins** widget. By default, this is the first widget on the system resources page.

Click on **Secrets**.

Provide the secret key in the **Secret key** field.

Provide the secret value in the **Secret value** field. Alternately, provide a local file path in the **Get secret value from file** menu.

Click **Create**.
